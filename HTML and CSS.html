    <h1>What is HTML and CSS?</h1>
   <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two fundamental technologies used in web development to create and style web pages. They work together to structure and design the content of a webpage. Here's an overview of each:</p>
   <hr>
   <h1>1_HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</h1>
    <p>.  Purpose: HTML is the backbone of a web page. It is used to structure and organize the content of a webpage, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more.</p>

    <h1>2_Markup:</h1>
    <p>HTML uses tags (enclosed in angle brackets) to define the structure and semantics of content. For example,  tags are used to define paragraphs, and  to tags are used for headings.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h1>3_Hierarchy:</h1>
    <p>HTML documents are organized as a hierarchical structure, with elements nested within other elements. This hierarchy defines the layout and relationships of content on the page.</p>
    <hr>
   <h1>4_Semantics:</h1>
   <p>HTML tags carry semantic meaning, which helps search engines and assistive technologies (like screen readers) understand the content's purpose and significance.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>5_Example:</h1>
    <p>A simple HTML structure for a webpage might include html, head, title, and body tags to define the document structure and content.</p>
<hr>
    <h1>6_CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</h1>
    <p>Purpose: CSS is used to control the presentation and visual style of HTML content. It defines how elements should be displayed on the screen or in print.</p>

   <h1>7_Style Rules:</h1>
   <p>CSS rules consist of selectors that target HTML elements and declarations that specify the properties (e.g., color, font size, margin) and values (e.g., red, 16px, 20px) that define the element's appearance.</p>
   <hr>
   <h1>8_Separation of Concerns: </h1>
    <p>CSS promotes the separation of content (HTML) and presentation (styling). This separation allows for easier maintenance and consistent design across a website.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>9_Cascading: </h1>
    <p>CSS is "cascading," meaning that styles can be inherited from parent elements and overridden or augmented by more specific rules. This cascading nature enables fine-grained control over styling.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>10_Example:</h1>
    <p>Here's a simple CSS rule that styles all p elements with red text and a 20-pixel margin:
        CSS can be included in HTML documents within style tags
        n the head section, linked from external CSS files, or applied inline directly to individual HTML elements.
        HTML and CSS work in conjunction to create visually appealing and well-structured web pages. HTML defines the content and structure, while CSS enhances the presentation, ensuring that web pages are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. This combination is fundamental to modern web development.
