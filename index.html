        <h1>First, What is programming?</h1>
        <p>Programming, in the context of computer science and software development, refers to the process of designing, writing, testing, and maintaining instructions (code) that a computer can understand and execute. These instructions are known as computer programs or software.

            Programming involves using a programming language to create a set of precise and logical instructions that tell a computer what to do. These instructions can perform a wide range of tasks, from simple calculations to complex data processing and user interactions. Programming is a fundamental skill in computer science and is used to develop applications, websites, games, operating systems, and much more.
